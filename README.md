# Hacker Jobs

The app displays the latest jobs advertised on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/jobs), using their [data api](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

It is a single page web app using frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML, served using a static web server, but with no other external libraries or frameworks. The app is test-driven using a framework developed inside the app, which also tests itself.
